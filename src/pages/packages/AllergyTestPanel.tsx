      <h2 className="text-xl font-medium text-bloodlyf-blue">Identify Your Allergic Triggers</h2>
      <p>
        Allergies affect millions of people worldwide, causing symptoms ranging from mildly annoying to severely debilitating or even life-threatening. An allergy occurs when your immune system reacts to a foreign substance that doesn't cause a reaction in most people. Identifying specific allergic triggers is crucial for effective management and symptom relief.
